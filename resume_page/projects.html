        <h3> Custom websites</h3>
        <p>In my spare time, I like to design layouts for potential clients or even for inspiration for my personal site. Most recently, I have been updating the website for my family's business, which has only furthered my understanding of HTML and CSS.</p>

        <h3>RPi Emulator</h3>
          <p>My love of nostalgic videogames knows no bounds, so a few weeks ago I finally bought my first Raspberry Pi and was able to successfully create an emulator that runs ROMs of games from consoles like SNES, Gameboy, SEGA Genesis, and N64. I hope to soon make an emulator that will also support Gamecube games in addition to all of the Nintendo ROMs I have, solely because I am committed to being able to play old versions of animal crossing.</p>

        <h3>Mazes(ruby)</h3>
          <p>When I initially moved to San Francisco, I didn't know anyone from the area except my partner (and his cute dog), so I poured myself into studying every day (truthfully, I still do) and came upon this book that guided me how to create programs with Ruby that would generate intricate mazes when run through the terminal. I came to LOVE building and tweaking the files so much, to the point where I created different types of maze styles, took intricate notes, and even colored mazes. I still to this day need to finish the book, but it was one of the most intricate and interesting projects I've done thus far.</p>
